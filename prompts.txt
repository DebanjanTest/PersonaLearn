MASTER PROJECT SPECIFICATION: PERSONALEARN
Deployment Status: Vercel-Ready (SPA)

1. PHILOSOPHY AND THE "SCIENCE OF NAMING"
The name **"PersonaLearn"** is not merely a label but a reflection of modern psychological and professional duality. 
- **The Science**: Human beings are polymathic by nature. We are rarely just one thing. An individual can be a *Teacher* by day, a *Student* of a new language by night, and a *Business Owner* on weekends.
- **The Application**: Unlike stagnant platforms that force a user into a single box (e.g., "Student Portal"), PersonaLearn creates a fluid "Social Architecture." It allows users to switch **Personas** instantly. The UI, toolsets, and AI context shift dynamically to match the user's active intent, reducing the friction between thought and execution.

2. ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION
- **Initial Prospectus**: The application was originally conceived to digitize the traditional **Teacher-Student feedback loop**, focusing on exam creation and evaluation.
- **Expansion**: Recognizing that education leads to employment and entrepreneurship, the platform evolved to include **Professional**, **Business**, **Interview Prep**, and **Aspirant** personas. It now serves the entire lifecycle of human growth—from learning A-B-C to negotiating a CEO's salary.

3. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE: PERSONALEARN VS. GOOGLE NOTEBOOKLM
PersonaLearn offers distinct advantages over passive RAG tools like Google NotebookLM:
- **Active vs. Passive**: NotebookLM allows chatting with docs. PersonaLearn **creates** deliverables: Print-ready Exam Papers, Investor Pitch Decks, Flashcards, and Code Artifacts.
- **Role-Specificity**: NotebookLM is generic. PersonaLearn offers specialized tools (e.g., "Salary Negotiator" for professionals, "Classroom Attendance" for teachers).
- **Evaluation Engine**: Unlike simple Q&A, PersonaLearn simulates full exams, evaluates subjective answers, and provides pedagogical feedback.
- **Offline Resilience**: Leveraging IndexedDB/LocalStorage allows for a robust, app-like experience even with intermittent connectivity, unlike purely cloud-reliant notebooks.

4. UI/UX & RESPONSIVENESS
The interface is built for aesthetic excellence and universal accessibility.
- **Hero Sections**: Each persona features a distinct, gradient-rich Hero section (e.g., Violet for Students, Emerald for Teachers) that grounds the user emotionally in their role.
- **Adaptive Navigation**: A collapsible sidebar ensures seamless navigation on mobile and desktop.
- **Themes**: Deep integration of Dark/Light modes with color-shifting palettes based on the active persona.
- **Responsiveness**: The app is fully fluid, testing perfectly across mobile (touch targets), tablet, and 4K desktop screens.

5. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (VERCEL DEPLOYMENT READY)
The application is structured for immediate deployment on Vercel as a Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Framework**: React 19 (Client-Side) with Next.js concepts.
- **Language Adaptability (i18n)**: The app features a robust, client-side translation engine. It currently supports **English, Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Marathi, and Telugu**. The structure allows for instant detection and transaction of languages without server roundtrips, making it blazing fast for users across India and international forums.
- **Environment**: Relies on `process.env.API_KEY` for Gemini integration, making it secure and easy to configure via Vercel Project Settings.
- **Storage**: Uses a hybrid of **LocalStorage** (Settings, History) and **IndexedDB** (Heavy assets like PDFs/Images) to ensure data persistence across sessions without a heavy backend database.
