MASTER PROJECT SPECIFICATION: PERSONALEARN

1. PHILOSOPHY AND NAMING SCIENCE
The name "PersonaLearn" is derived from the psychological concept of a "Persona"—the social face an individual presents to the world—combined with the continuous pursuit of knowledge. The science behind this naming lies in the understanding that an individual is rarely stagnant in a single role. A user might be a "Student" in the morning learning Physics, an "Aspirant" in the evening preparing for competitive exams, and a "Professional" on weekends managing a freelance business.

PersonaLearn is built to support this multifaceted nature of human growth. Unlike niche applications that restrict users to a single forum, PersonaLearn creates a diversified ecosystem where the UI and toolsets adapt dynamically to the user's current intent. It enables fluid transitions between learning, teaching, working, and strategizing, ensuring the technology molds to the user's immediate needs rather than forcing the user to adapt to the software.

2. EVOLUTION AND TARGET SECTORS
Initially conceptualized as a dedicated bridge between Teachers and Students to digitize the classroom experience, the application has evolved into a comprehensive multi-persona platform. While the core "Social Architecture" remains rooted in the educational feedback loop, the platform now targets:
- The Education Sector (K-12 & Higher Ed) via Student and Teacher personas.
- The Corporate Sector via the Professional persona.
- The Entrepreneurial Sector via the Business persona.
- The Employment Market via Interview Prep and Aspirant personas.

3. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE: PERSONALEARN VS. GOOGLE NOTEBOOKLM
While Google NotebookLM excels at passive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—allowing users to "chat" with their documents—it has significant limitations that PersonaLearn addresses:
- Lack of Active Creation: NotebookLM analyzes existing text. PersonaLearn actively generates new artifacts: full Exam Papers, structured Pitch Decks, Flashcards, and Code solutions.
- Role-Agnosticism: NotebookLM provides a generic interface. PersonaLearn offers specialized tools (e.g., Salary Negotiator for professionals, Code Playground for students) that provide context-aware utility.
- Evaluation Gap: NotebookLM can answer questions but cannot rigorously simulate an exam environment, evaluate user answers against a marking scheme, and provide graded feedback. PersonaLearn's "Student Exam" feature fills this critical pedagogical gap.
- Offline/Local capabilities: PersonaLearn leverages IndexedDB for robust local file handling and persistent history, offering a more app-like experience than a purely cloud-based notebook.

4. USER INTERFACE AND INTERACTION DESIGN
The UI is designed for high responsiveness and aesthetic engagement, utilizing a "Hero Section" pattern to ground the user in their current role.
- Visual Language: The application uses a collapsible sidebar for navigation and distinct color themes for each persona (Violet for Students, Emerald for Teachers, Slate for Professionals, etc.).
- Hero Sections: Every dashboard opens with a vibrant, gradient-rich Hero section containing a personalized greeting, context-aware status updates (e.g., "Study Streak", "Pending Reviews"), and "Quick Action" buttons for immediate engagement.
- Responsiveness: The layout adapts fluidly from desktop to mobile, with touch-friendly targets and mobile-optimized menus.
- Interaction: Users interact via drag-and-drop file uploads, chat interfaces, and click-to-flip flashcards. The experience is designed to be tactile and immediate, minimizing the friction between thought and digital action.

5. DETAILED PERSONA ECOSYSTEMS

5.1 The Student Ecosystem (Core Feature)
